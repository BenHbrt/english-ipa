# Phonemic Chart (British English)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

I wrote this project as as part of my GitHub portfolio. As I have a background in English language teaching and training, I thought that it would be a good idea to use my coding skills to create an app to help trainee entry-level and diploma-level teachers understand the phonemic chart.

There are many phonemic charts online with either audio or keyboard functionality, but a colleague of mine suggested that I code an app which combines both.

## The tech side of things

I am a big fan of the React.js library, so decided to use it to code this app. At the outset, I saw that the nesting of the components provided a good opportunity to practise using the useContext hook, which I had been taught during the bootcamp I had studied, but had not used in any of my portfolio projects since. I decided to use Scss for the styling, as it allowed me to use nesting and variables when coding.
